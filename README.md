# # Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository contains implementation of various data structures and algorithms in C++ programming language.
## Compiling a C++ Program using Command Line
1.  Open a terminal or command prompt window.
2.  Navigate to the directory where your C++ program is located using the `cd` command.
3.  Type the following command to compile your program:



`g++ program_name.cpp -o output_file_name` 

Here, `program_name.cpp` is the name of your C++ source code file, and `output_file_name` is the desired name for the compiled executable file.

4.  If there are no errors, the compilation will finish, and you should see a new file with the name you specified in the command.
5.  To run the compiled program, type:



`./output_file_name` 

This will execute the compiled program and show the output.

Note that you need to have the `g++` compiler installed on your system to be able to compile C++ programs on the command line.
